## SECTION 7: FRIDAY EXHIBITION 2025 PROJECTS

**Event Details:**
**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Day:** Friday
**Event Name:**Friday Exhibition
**Focus:** Student Projects and Practical Demonstrations

**Subject: Mathematics Project**
**Project Title:** Comparison of Volume and Surface Area in Solid Objects
**Project Goal:** To find formulas to calculate Surface Area and Volume of a cone and cylinder separately versus combined.
**Process:**
1. Separate solid objects of a cone and a cylinder are formed.
2. A combined figure of a cone and a cylinder is also formed.
3. We calculate the Area and Volume of the separate figures.
4. Finally, find the Volume and Surface Area of the Combined Figure.
**Key Finding (Conclusion):** There is no difference in the total volume when figures are separate or combined. However, there is a difference in the Total Surface Area (TSA) by 2πr². This happens because the combined figure loses the area of the circular face where the cone and cylinder join.

**Subject: Science Project**
**Project Title:** Conservation of Environment with Utilization of Water
**Materials Required:** Water, water pump, battery, connecting wires, cardboard, thermocol, leveller, PVC pipe, cotton, glue, dead bulb, siren sensor, humidity sensor.
**Working Principle:**
The model simulates a factory producing polluted air (burning agarbatti/dhoop). This smoke is absorbed by a fan and motor into a "carbon absorber box".
The carbon absorber box contains cotton, which filters carbon and other impurities, converting the smoke into fresh air.
An air pump then pushes this purified air outside. In an artificial atmosphere, a humidifier maintains humidity to form a closed cloud system, which produces rainfall.
**Applications:** The collected water is stored in a reservoir and used to generate electricity via a turbine. After electricity production, the water is used for irrigation.

**Subject: English Project**
**Topic:** Parts of Speech (The Sentence Family)
**Description:** This project visualizes the eight parts of speech as "family members" that build a complete sentence.
**The 8 Parts:**
1. Noun
2. Pronoun
3. Verb
4. Adverb
5. Adjective
6. Preposition
7. Conjunction
8. Interjection

**Subject: Social Studies (Samajik) Project**
**Topic:** Nepal's Architecture (Nepal Ko Bastukala)
**Content:** The project displays the main architectural styles of Nepal.
**Architectural Styles:**
- Pagoda Style (Pyagoda Saili)
- Dome Style (Gumbaj Saili)
- Shikhar Style (Shikhar Saili)
**Historical Context:** The project also references the People's Movement (Jana Andolan) of 2062-063 BS.

**Subject: Nepali Project**
**Topic:** Nepali Grammar and Literature
**Grammar (Padwarga):** Naam (Noun), Sarwanaam (Pronoun), Bisheshan (Adjective), Kriya (Verb), Kriya-Bisheshan (Adverb), Sambandha-Bodak (Preposition), Samuchchaya-Bodak (Conjunction), Bismayaadi-Bodak (Interjection).
**Additional Topics:**
